// The purpose of the code in this module is to prevent users from triggering
// unsupported upgrade paths between Gravity versions during cluster upgrades.
//
// An upgrade path is generally considered unsupported if the "upgrade from"
// and "upgrade to" versions are too many major/minor versions apart such as
// the direct upgrade between their respective embedded Kubernetes versions
// is not supported according to Kubernetes version skew policy (normally 2
// releases):
//
// https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/release/version-skew-policy/
//
// Kubernetes versions embedded into all Gravity releases are available on
// our releases page:
//
// https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/changelog/
//
// Some Gravity versions support automatic upgrades between far-apart versions
// if the "upgrade to" cluster image includes one or more runtimes that can
// be used as intermediate hops:
//
// https://gravitational.com/gravity/docs/cluster/#direct-upgrades-from-older-lts-versions
